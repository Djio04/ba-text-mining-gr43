    "This notebook describes the LAB-3 assignment of the Text Mining course. It is about sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aims of the assignment are:\n",
    "* Learn how to run a rule-based sentiment analysis module (VADER)\n",
    "* Learn how to run a machine learning sentiment analysis module (Scikit-Learn/ Naive Bayes)\n",
    "* Learn how to run scikit-learn metrics for the quantitative evaluation\n",
    "* Learn how to perform and interpret a quantitative evaluation of the outcomes of the tools (in terms of Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub>)\n",
    "* Learn how to evaluate the results qualitatively (by examining the data) \n",
    "* Get insight into differences between the two applied methods\n",
    "* Get insight into the effects of using linguistic preprocessing\n",
    "* Be able to describe differences between the two methods in terms of their results\n",
    "* Get insight into issues when applying these methods across different  domains\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you are going to create your own gold standard set from 50 tweets. You will the VADER and scikit-learn classifiers to these tweets and evaluate the results by using evaluation metrics and inspecting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend you go through the notebooks in the following order:\n",
    "* **Read the assignment (see below)**\n",
    "* **Lab3.2-Sentiment-analysis-with-VADER.ipynb**\n",
    "* **Lab3.3-Sentiment-analysis.with-scikit-learn.ipynb**\n",
    "* **Answer the questions of the assignment (see below) using the provided notebooks and submit**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you are asked to perform both quantitative evaluations and error analyses:\n",
    "* a quantitative evaluation concerns the scores (Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub>) provided by scikit's classification_report. It includes the scores per category, as well as micro and macro averages. Discuss whether the scores are balanced or not between the different categories (positive, negative, neutral) and between precision and recall. Discuss the shortcomings (if any) of the classifier based on these scores\n",
    "* an error analysis regarding the misclassifications of the classifier. It involves going through the texts and trying to understand what has gone wrong. It servers to get insight in what could be done to improve the performance of the classifier. Do you observe patterns in misclassifications?  Discuss why these errors are made and propose ways to solve them."

    "* VADER uses rules to handle linguistic phenomena such as negation and intensification. Be sure to understand which rules are used, how they work, and why they are important.\n",
    "* VADER makes use of a sentiment lexicon. Have a look at the lexicon. Be sure to understand which information can be found there (lemma?, wordform?, part-of-speech?, polarity value?, word meaning?) What do all scores mean? https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/master/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### [3.5 points] Question1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regard the following sentences and their output as given by VADER. Regard sentences 1 to 7, and explain the outcome **for each sentence**. Take into account both the rules applied by VADER and the lexicon that is used. You will find that some of the results are reasonable, but others are not. Explain what is going wrong or not when correct and incorrect results are produced. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "INPUT SENTENCE 1 I love apples\n",
    "VADER OUTPUT {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.192, 'pos': 0.808, 'compound': 0.6369}\n",
    "```\n",
    "**answer:** VADER took every word seperately and evaluated the sentiment, it likely took the word 'love' and evaluated it as very positive, and the rest of the words as slightly positive/ generally neutral (neg score 0.0 implies it did not evaluate any word as negative), giving the whole sentence a compound score of around 0.64\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "INPUT SENTENCE 2 I don't love apples\n",
    "VADER OUTPUT {'neg': 0.627, 'neu': 0.373, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5216}\n",
    "```\n",
    "**answer:** VADER likely recognized 'don't' and 'love' together to evaluate it as quite negative, it's interesting to note though that it does recognize that sentence 2 is negative but less strongly than sentence 1 being positive, as sentence 1 is definetly strongly positive but sentence 2 is generally negative but 'don't love' does not imply a strong dislike.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "INPUT SENTENCE 3 I love apples :-)\n",
    "VADER OUTPUT {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.133, 'pos': 0.867, 'compound': 0.7579}\n",
    "```\n",
    "**answer:** VADER likely evaluated the sentence so much more positive in comparison to sentence 1 due to the addition of the emoticon, since it is also able to handle and evaluate them\n",
    "```\n",
    "INPUT SENTENCE 4 These houses are ruins\n",
    "VADER OUTPUT {'neg': 0.492, 'neu': 0.508, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4404}\n",
    "```\n",
    "**answer:** I think VADER is quite poor at handling words with multiple meanings, like the word \"ruins\". Though the sentence is quite accuratly evaluated as neutral, it still leans quite close towards negative, since a house being a ruin could be a negative thing, it's well evaluated in my opinion.\n",
    "```\n",
    "INPUT SENTENCE 5 These houses are certainly not considered ruins\n",
    "VADER OUTPUT {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.51, 'pos': 0.49, 'compound': 0.5867}\n",
    "```\n",
    "**answer:** This is one of those sentences where the evaluation doesn't seem to make much sense. VADER evaluated words it considers very positive like 'certainly' well and took the rest of the sentence as neutral, but it likely tried negating 'not (negative) considered ruins(negative)' resulting in the sentence having a positive compound evaluation\n",
    "```\n",
    "INPUT SENTENCE 6 He lies in the chair in the garden\n",
    "VADER OUTPUT {'neg': 0.286, 'neu': 0.714, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4215}\n",
    "```\n",
    "**answer:** Although this definitely seems like a neutral sentence, it's really likely the word \"lies\" is considered negative in VADER's lexicon, probably as the human evaluators thought of the word lies as in lying, not lying down, resulting in a negative compound score.\n",
    "```\n",
    "INPUT SENTENCE 7 This house is like any house\n",
    "VADER OUTPUT {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.667, 'pos': 0.333, 'compound': 0.3612}\n",
    "```\n",
    "**answer:** Although the neutral compound score is definetly accurate, it's possible the slight positive bias comes from the word 'like'\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Looking at the scores and comparing them overall, we can see that adjectives have higher scores for all categories compared to verbs and nouns, which tells us that sentiment is expressed the best with adjectives. If comparing nouns and verbs, nouns have slightly higher macro and weighted averages for all categories (precision, recall and f1 score), only the weighted average for recall is the exact same (0.54).\n",
    "2. In theory, lemmatisation does help - it simplifies the words by transforming it to its root form, thus it reduces variation and vocabulary becomes less complicated. The only downside could be that some words might lose their actual precise meaning if the prefix or sufix is removed. However, in this case above, the scores for raw and lemmatized tweets are the same; lemmatization does not impact the scores at all.\n",
    "3. Not all parts of speech equally important for sentiment analysis - the most important are adjectives, then nouns and verbs which add context as well, but for instance pronouns or prepositions do not contribute to sentiment analysis (words like \"in\", \"at\", \"she\" do not express emotion at all, while \"wonderful\" and \"joy\" do."
