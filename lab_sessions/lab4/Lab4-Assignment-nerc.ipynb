    "- The part with percentage count in the output of the cell below clearly indicates the imbalance of training and test data when looking at them separately. For both test and train data, the \"O\" label, which is used to label the words that are not a part of any category of named entity, dominates with 83.28% and 82.53%, respectively. This can lead to biases in the model and incorrect labeling. And looking at percentage of labels that start with I or B and comparing them, we can see that in general, NERC labels that start with B ahave higher percentages, which means that the most named entities are shorter rather than longer. If comparing test and training data with each other, they do have similar percentages for the same labels, not having differences of more than ~1%, some of them having a difference only of 0.02% (for example I-LOC, with 0.57% and 0.55%)."
